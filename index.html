		<h1>Here's the news</h1>
		
		<p>Some news.</p>

		<p>Practiced deleting a local branch, but github still shows the "news" branch, and my local repo reports "Everything up-to-date". I wonder if pushing this change will update the fact there's no local branch. Probably not... it seems the local branch doesn't compare branches to the master on github.</p>
